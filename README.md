# Developer Guide

## Getting started

Here is a simple example on how to try out the add-on component:

Add widgetset dependency:

```xml
<inherits name="it.zero11.vaadin.asyncfiltercombobox.WidgetSet" /> 
```

Use AsyncFilterComboBox like built-in ComboBox (the default behaviour include 500ms delay).

To Change the delay call:
```
asyncfilterComboBox.setFilterChangeTimeout(2000);
```
To Revert the behaviour to built-in ComboBox:
```
asyncfilterComboBox.setFilterChangeEventMode(FilterChangeEventMode.EAGER);
```
